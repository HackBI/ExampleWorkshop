# HackBI Example Workshop
> A quick blurb about what your workshop is about. Make sure you change the above line to match your workshop and that both it and the repo name ends in "Workshop" to distinguish it from other projects. Your writeup, like this one, should be written in Markdown. See Resources for Further Learning.

## Get Started
What to do first. Download files, install programs, make accounts, etc. For the purposes of this workshop, make sure you have a GitHub account and are a member of our organization. You might also want to check out the GitHub workshop at https://github.com/hackbi/githubworkshop.

## Uses
What your workshop topic is used for. 

## Purpose
What your workshop intends to accomplish. This workshop will help you to have an understanding of how to create a HackBI Workshop. Much more vague than "Goal".

## Goal
The end goal of this workshop. Nothing vague, like "a better understanding of Python", but the actual end goal of the project or "Challenges" you're presenting.

## Challenges
1. List of challenges you're presenting.
2. The "Goal" of the workshop broken down into more concrete steps.

## Cheat Sheet
You don't have to put this if it doesn't make sense for your workhsop, but it's very helpful to put syntax hints and such here. GitHub Markdown code blocks are extremely useful, i.e.
```python
while True:
    print('this text is inside a python code block.')
```

## More Stuff
Feel free to add a couple more of these, like "How to set up Python on a Mac" or something like that. Keep in mind that this workshop writeup should be brief and shouldn't have more information on it than your workshop presents.
